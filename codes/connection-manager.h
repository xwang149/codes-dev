/**
 * @class ConnectionManager
 *
 * @brief
 * This class is meant to make organization of the connections between routers more
 * streamlined. It provides a simple, readable interface which helps reduce
 * semantic errors during development.
 *
 * @note
 * This class was designed with dragonfly type topologies in mind. Certain parts may not
 * make sense for other types of topologies, they might work fine, but no guarantees.
 *
 * @note
 * There is the property intermediateRouterToGroupMap and related methods that are implemented but the
 * logistics to get this information from input file is more complicated than its worth so I have commented
 * them out.
 *
 * @note
 * This class assumes that each router group has the same number of routers in it: _num_routers_per_group.
